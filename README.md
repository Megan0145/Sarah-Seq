### Sarah-Seq

My name is Sarah (obviously) and I'm a PhD student studying Genomics Data Science in NUI Galway. I recently had my whole genome sequenced by Dante labs (https://www.dantelabs.com/) and started this side project to illustrate just how cool genomics can be. I wanted to demonstrate the amount of information you can infer from someones genome and also point out some of the limitations associated with these predictions.
